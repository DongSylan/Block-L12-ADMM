#Block-L12-ADMM
The codes are used to recover the block-sparse signals.
1. All the codes are written by Wendong Wang, the first author of the paper titled "Block-sparse signal recovery via $\ell_{2}/\ell_{1-2}$ minimization method".
2. Our algorithm is coded in Block_L1L2.m.
3. Please feel free to contact Wendong Wang by any of following two Emails: 1) d.sylan@foxmail.com 2) d.w.sylan@gmail.com
